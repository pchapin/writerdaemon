  <title>Building WriterDaemon</title>

  <para>This chapter describes how to build WriterDaemon and its associated documentation. If
    you are using a binary distribution of WriterDaemon you can skip this section. The tools
    with specific version numbers shown below are the official tools used by the WriterDaemon
    contributors. Other tools (or other versions of the same tools) may also work. Obviously the
    greater the differences between the tools you attempt to use and those listed below the more
    trouble you are likely to encounter during the build process.</para>

    <title>Build Tools</title>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>IntelliJ IDEA</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>We use IntelliJ IDEA v15.0.4 with the Scala plugin as our integrated development
          environment.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>Scala Compiler</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>We use Scala v2.11.7. The Scala compiler is executed indirectly via IntelliJ IDEA
          Currently no official method of building WriterDaemon outside the IDE is
          provided.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>DocBook</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>The documentation is written in DocBook. This is an XML format and so is readable
          in an ordinary text editor. However, if you want to build nicely formatted
          documentation you will need a tool chain for processing DocBook documents. Several
          such tool chains exist.</para>

    specific details about setting up IntelliJ IDEA and building the WriterDaemon system.</para>
