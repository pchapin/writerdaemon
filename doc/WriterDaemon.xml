    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>WriterDaemon is a system for providing assistance to creative writers. It is an
      analysis program for English prose. The problem of automatically extracting useful
      information about a body of English text is extremely difficult. WriterDaemon addresses
      this difficulty by having relatively low expectations. The first versions of the system
      are expected to only provide very basic information about the text being analyzed.
      However, it is my hope that in time WriterDaemon will mature enough to be useful in more
      complex situations.</para>

    <para>In the short term I hope to use WriterDaemon as a vehicle for teaching about Scala. In
      that capacity the details of its analysis capabilities don't matter. Instead the
      techniques used for implementing, testing, and documenting the system are more
      important.</para>
